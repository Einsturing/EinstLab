# EinstLab
* One of the personal recommendation topics for school C++ curriculum design, function graphics drawing tools. <br>
* Using `QT` development, it supports trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, power functions, exponential functions and other elementary mathematical functions, supports polynomials, supports parametric equations, and resolves arbitrary complex expressions.<br>
* The expression parsing algorithm uses inverse Polish expressions and stack operations, and the QT plugin `qwt` is used for drawing.<br>
* The poor work of the chicken, everyone laughs.<br>
